This repo includes several challenges about building "toy" programs, the kinds of programs you'd almost certainly never build in reality but provide a familiar context to help you focus on learning the technology as opposed to solving some unknown problem.

These are great for review and for building your confidence.  We've also included a few dozen examples of each so you can get an idea of how many different ways you can solve these things.

If you're interested in more of these, you'll find a few at [Coders Dojo](http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue).  Of course, feel free to add a pull request to this document if you find your own!

And here's a video of our very own Steven Harms working through a few tradeoffs between convenience, complexity and clarity:

[Ruby Conf 2013 - Preferring Object-Orientation to Metaprogramming (35 mins)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3OhoWCnlB0)

> Metaprogramming in Ruby is a mixed blessing: it makes many impossible things possible. This quicker, easier, more seductive path, however, can lead to contorted code that's difficult to maintain and can be hard to understand. So what's the alternative? For many uses of metaprogramming, good object-orientation, or a well-chosen design pattern, can provide just as much power without the challenges to intelligibility. This talk aims to (re)introduce several key Object Orientation concepts, and a few critical design patterns, then present them as superior alternatives to metaprogrammatic approaches.
