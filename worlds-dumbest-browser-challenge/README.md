# World's Dumbest Browser 
 
##Learning Competencies 
- Use Net::HTTP to download and read html pages
- Use the Nokogiri gem to parse CSS elements 
- Identify and implement classes based on real world requirements
- Create well-defined classes with a single responsibility


##Summary 

 We're going to build the dumbest web browser in the world.  It will work like this:

```text
$ ruby browser.rb
url> http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/06/travel/private-jets/index.html
Fetching...
Title: 'Redneck' speed freak buys super-fast jet
Content length: 10,123 characters
Links:
  http://whatever.com/something.html
  etc..
  etc..
```

We'll be using Ruby's built-in [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3//libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) library to fetch the page and then using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) to parse the HTML the page returns.

We want you to start getting familiar with how the web works.  Everything your program does a browser has to do too.

### Release 0: Basic Toy Browser 

#### Listing the Responsibilities

Start by listing the core responsibilities of your app.  Some of these responsibilities include:

* Displaying a prompt for the user
* Parsing user input
* Fetching a web page
* Extracting the relevant information from the web page
* Displaying the relevant information in a user-friendly way
* *etc.*

There are more &mdash; make sure you list them out!  Next, group these responsibilities into "concerns".  Prompting a user for input and taking the appropriate action might be one concern, for example.  Fetching a URL and returning an easy-to-display data structure might be another.

#### Toy Code

Get familiar with the [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3//libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) module.  Here's a good [Net::HTTP cheatsheet](http://www.rubyinside.com/nethttp-cheat-sheet-2940.html) to help you.

Write some toy code and fetch some web pages. Get your toy code to create the sample output shown in the initial example before moving on to Release 1.

What kind of objects do `Net::HTTP` methods return?  Should your program expose those objects directly?

**Hint:** No.  Wrap them up in objects that more directly express what your code *does* rather than how its implemented.



### Release 1: Object-Oriented Browser

#### Create Custom Objects 

Start with a `Page` class that works like this:

```ruby
page = Page.new('http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/06/travel/private-jets/index.html')

# Actually makes the HTTP request
page.fetch!

# Returns the URL of the underlying page
page.url

# Returns an Array of URLs (as Strings).
page.links

# Returns the page's title
page.title
```

See the original gist for where to put the "driver" code.  You should have a `Browser` class that acts as the "brain" rather than lots of code living outside of a class.

##Optimize Your Learning
* Read up on [Separation of Concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).  
* What responsibilities does your program have to fulfill?  What classes do you need to fulfill those responsibilities?  
* Where are the boundaries between the classes &mdash; how do they communicate with each other?
