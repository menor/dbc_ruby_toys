# Orange Tree 1 Just Oranges 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Modeling systems with objects.
* Use instance variables and accessor methods effectively
* Work with objects in Ruby

##Summary 

 We're in California, and California grows oranges &mdash; mostly [Washington navel oranges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_%28fruit%29#Navel_oranges) and [Valencia oranges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_orange), for the botanists among us.

Let's create a toy program to model an orange tree growing over the years.  We plant the orange tree, wait for it to bear some fruit, and then pick all the oranges as soon as it does.

The script might look like this:

```ruby
tree = OrangeTree.new

tree.age! until tree.any_oranges?

puts "Tree is #{tree.age} years old and #{tree.height} feet tall"

until tree.dead?
  basket = []

  # It places the oranges in the basket
  # IT PLACES THE ORANGES IN THE BASKET
  while tree.any_oranges?
    basket << tree.pick_an_orange!
  end

  avg_diameter = # It's up to you to calculate the average diameter for this harvest.

  puts "Year #{tree.age} Report"
  puts "Tree height: #{tree.height} feet"
  puts "Harvest:     #{basket.size} oranges with an average diameter of #{avg_diameter} inches"
  puts ""

  # Age the tree another year
  tree.age!
end

puts "Alas, the tree, she is dead!"
```

##Releases

###Release 0 : Implement the OrangeTree and Orange classes

Use `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and/or `attr_accessor` so that we can call `tree.height` and `tree.age` to get a tree's height or age, respectively.  Which of the three `attr_` methods should you be using and why?

Do the same with the `Orange` class so that we can call `orange.diameter` to get an orange's diamater.

#### Implement Aging

As a tree ages, it grows taller.  Eventually it starts bearing fruit and stops growing &mdash; not necessarily at the same time.  Some years later, the tree dies and can bear fruit no more!

Implement an `OrangeTree#age!` instance method that will age your tree one year.  Each year the tree should get some amount taller, and then eventually stop growing.  You can decide when the tree stops growing.

Later, it should die.  At this point your `OrangeTree` class should:

1. Have an `OrangeTree#height` method which returns the tree's current height
2. Have an `OrangeTree#age` method which returns the tree's current age
3. Have an `OrangeTree#age!` method which ages the tree one year and grows the tree a little, if it's able to grow
4. Have an `OrangeTree#dead?` method which returns `true` if the tree has died

#### Implement Orange-picking

After some number of years &mdash; you decide &mdash; the orange tree starts to bear fruit.  Write a method `OrangeTree#any_oranges?` which returns `true` if there are any oranges on the tree and `false` otherwise.

Also write a method `OrangeTree#pick_an_orange!` which will return one of the oranges on the tree (an instance of the `Orange` class).  If you try to pick an orange when there are no oranges left, your code should raise a `NoOrangesError` (defined in the source code).

You'll also have to implement the `Orange` class at this point, including `Orange.new` and `Orange#diameter`.

#### Does the script run?

Does the script at the top of the challenge run and output what you'd expect?  (Hint: you have to be clear about your expectations before you an answer that question.)

If not, what are the errors or unexpected behaviors?  Do you understand them?
